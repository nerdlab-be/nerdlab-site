# InuitCSS plugin: responsive wrapper

A responsive wrapper object for the [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) framework.

Works as a drop-in replacement for the default `objects.wrapper.scss` layout object by using the same classes and variables.

## How to use
Replace the `objects.wrapper.scss` reference in your screen.scss file with `objects.responsive-wrapper.scss`. Make sure that you put the correct path if you load this with NPM.
